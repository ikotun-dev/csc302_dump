### DSA

data structure - way of organize data in computer so that it can be used effectively.<br/>
different data structures suit specific use case.<br/>

common data structures:<br/>

1. array<br/>
2. linked list <br/>
3. stack <br/>
4. queue <br/>
5. tree<br/>
6. graph<br/>
7. hash table <br/>

### Algorithm

an algorithm is simply a step by step procedure to solve a problem. { sequence of instructions }<br/>

### Big O notation

Big O is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.<br/>
In my own words - It is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space complexity.<br/>
time complexity : how long it takes to run<br/>
space complexity : how much memory it takes<br/>
