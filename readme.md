### DSA

data structure - way of organizing data in computer so that it can be used effectively.<br/>
different data structures suit specific use case.<br/>

common data structures:<br/>

1. array<br/>
2. linked list <br/>
3. stack <br/>
4. queue <br/>
5. tree<br/>
6. graph<br/>
7. hash table <br/>

### Algorithm

an algorithm is simply a step by step procedure to solve a problem. { sequence of instructions }<br/>

### Big O notation

Big O is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.<br/>

> In my own words - It is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space complexity.<br/>
> time complexity : how long it takes to run<br/>
> space complexity : how much memory it takes<br/>

### common big O notation

> O(1) - constant time : this means regardless of the problem size, it would take the same time to run. <br/>
> O(log n) - logarithmic time : this means the time it takes to run increases logarithmically with the size of the input. ( logarithmic in the sense that, it grows at a small rate..and not arithmetically or geometrically)<br/>
> O(n) - linear time : this means the time it takes to run increases linearly with the size of the input. : linear -> arithmetically <br/>
> O(n^2) - quadratic time : this means the time it takes to run increases quadratically with the size of the input. : quadratic -> geometrically <br/>
